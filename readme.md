# Simple Unit Converter (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS)

This repository contains a simple web-based unit converter built using only standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS). It allows users to easily convert values between common units across various categories like length, weight, volume, temperature, and time.
